4.3 Fallacies of relevance
What all fallacies of relevance have in common is that they make an argument or
response to an argument that is irrelevant. Fallacies of relevance can be
compelling psychologically, but it is important to distinguish between rhetorical
techniques that are psychologically compelling, on the one hand, and rationally
compelling arguments, on the other. What makes something a fallacy is that it
fails to be rationally compelling, once we have carefully considered it. That said,
arguments that fail to be rationally compelling may still be psychologically or
emotionally compelling. The first fallacy of relevance that we will consider, the
ad hominem fallacy, is an excellent example a fallacy that can be psychologically
compelling.

4.3.1 Ad hominem
``Ad hominem" is a Latin phrase that can be translated into English as the phrase,
``against the man." In an ad hominem fallacy, instead of responding to (or
attacking) the argument a person has made, one attacks the person him or
herself. In short, one attacks the person making the argument rather than the
argument itself. Here is an anecdote that reveals an ad hominem fallacy (and
that has actually occurred in my ethics class before).
A philosopher named Peter Singer had made an argument that it is
morally wrong to spend money on luxuries for oneself rather than give all
of your money that you don't strictly need away to charity. The argument
is actually an argument from analogy (whose details I discussed in section
3.3), but the essence of the argument is that there are every day in this
world children who die preventable deaths, and there are charities who

199

Chapter 4: Informal fallacies

could save the lives of these children if they are funded by individuals
from wealthy countries like our own. Since there are things that we all
regularly buy that we don't need (e.g., Starbuck's lattes, beer, movie
tickets, or extra clothes or shoes we don't really need), if we continue to
purchase those things rather than using that money to save the lives of
children, then we are essentially contributing to the deaths of those
children if we choose to continue to live our lifestyle of buying things we
don't need, rather than donating the money to a charity that will save
lives of children in need. In response to Singer's argument, one student
in the class asked: ``Does Peter Singer give his money to charity? Does
he do what he says we are all morally required to do?"
The implication of this student's question (which I confirmed by following up
with her) was that if Peter Singer himself doesn't donate all his extra money to
charities, then his argument isn't any good and can be dismissed. But that
would be to commit an ad hominem fallacy. Instead of responding to the
argument that Singer had made, this student attacked Singer himself. That is,
they wanted to know how Singer lived and whether he was a hypocrite or not.
Was he the kind of person who would tell us all that we had to live a certain way
but fail to live that way himself? But all of this is irrelevant to assessing Singer's
argument. Suppose that Singer didn't donate his excess money to charity and
instead spent it on luxurious things for himself. Still, the argument that Singer
has given can be assessed on its own merits. Even if it were true that Peter
Singer was a total hypocrite, his argument may nevertheless be rationally
compelling. And it is the quality of the argument that we are interested in, not
Peter Singer's personal life and whether or not he is hypocritical. Whether
Singer is or isn't a hypocrite, is irrelevant to whether the argument he has put
forward is strong or weak, valid or invalid. The argument stands on its own and
it is that argument rather than Peter Singer himself that we need to assess.
Nonetheless, there is something psychologically compelling about the question:
Does Peter Singer practice what he preaches? I think what makes this question
seem compelling is that humans are very interested in finding ``cheaters" or
hypocrites--those who say one thing and then do another. Evolutionarily, our
concern with cheaters makes sense because cheaters can't be trusted and it is
essential for us (as a group) to be able to pick out those who can't be trusted.
That said, whether or not a person giving an argument is a hypocrite is irrelevant
to whether that person's argument is good or bad. So there may be
psychological reasons why humans are prone to find certain kinds of ad

200

Chapter 4: Informal fallacies

hominem fallacies psychologically compelling, even though ad hominem
fallacies are not rationally compelling.
Not every instance in which someone attacks a person's character is an ad
hominem fallacy. Suppose a witness is on the stand testifying against a
defendant in a court of law. When the witness is cross examined by the defense
lawyer, the defense lawyer tries to go for the witness's credibility, perhaps by
digging up things about the witness's past. For example, the defense lawyer
may find out that the witness cheated on her taxes five years ago or that the
witness failed to pay her parking tickets. The reason this isn't an ad hominem
fallacy is that in this case the lawyer is trying to establish whether what the
witness is saying is true or false and in order to determine that we have to know
whether the witness is trustworthy. These facts about the witness's past may be
relevant to determining whether we can trust the witness's word. In this case,
the witness is making claims that are either true or false rather than giving an
argument. In contrast, when we are assessing someone's argument, the
argument stands on its own in a way the witness's testimony doesn't. In
assessing an argument, we want to know whether the argument is strong or
weak and we can evaluate the argument using the logical techniques surveyed
in this text. In contrast, when a witness is giving testimony, they aren't trying to
argue anything. Rather, they are simply making a claim about what did or didn't
happen. So although it may seem that a lawyer is committing an ad hominem
fallacy in bringing up things about the witness's past, these things are actually
relevant to establishing the witness's credibility. In contrast, when considering
an argument that has been given, we don't have to establish the arguer's
credibility because we can assess the argument they have given on its own
merits. The arguer's personal life is irrelevant.
4.3.2 Straw man
Suppose that my opponent has argued for a position, call it position A, and in
response to his argument, I give a rationally compelling argument against
position B, which is related to position A, but is much less plausible (and thus
much easier to refute). What I have just done is attacked a straw man--a
position that ``looks like" the target position, but is actually not that position.
When one attacks a straw man, one commits the straw man fallacy. The straw
man fallacy misrepresents one's opponent's argument and is thus a kind of
irrelevance. Here is an example.

201

Chapter 4: Informal fallacies

Two candidates for political office in Colorado, Tom and Fred, are having
an exchange in a debate in which Tom has laid out his plan for putting
more money into health care and education and Fred has laid out his plan
which includes earmarking more state money for building more prisons
which will create more jobs and, thus, strengthen Colorado's economy.
Fred responds to Tom's argument that we need to increase funding to
health care and education as follows: ``I am surprised, Tom, that you are
willing to put our state's economic future at risk by sinking money into
these programs that do not help to create jobs. You see, folks, Tom's
plan will risk sending our economy into a tailspin, risking harm to
thousands of Coloradans. On the other hand, my plan supports a healthy
and strong Colorado and would never bet our state's economic security
on idealistic notions that simply don't work when the rubber meets the
road."
Fred has committed the straw man fallacy. Just because Tom wants to increase
funding to health care and education does not mean he does not want to help
the economy. Furthermore, increasing funding to health care and education
does not entail that fewer jobs will be created. Fred has attacked a position that
is not the position that Tom holds, but is in fact a much less plausible, easier to
refute position. However, it would be silly for any political candidate to run on a
platform that included ``harming the economy." Presumably no political
candidate would run on such a platform. Nonetheless, this exact kind of straw
man is ubiquitous in political discourse in our country.
Here is another example.
Nancy has just argued that we should provide middle schoolers with sex
education classes, including how to use contraceptives so that they can
practice safe sex should they end up in the situation where they are
having sex. Fran responds: ``proponents of sex education try to
encourage our children to a sex-with-no-strings-attached mentality, which
is harmful to our children and to our society."
Fran has committed the straw man (or straw woman) fallacy by misrepresenting
Nancy's position. Nancy's position is not that we should encourage children to
have sex, but that we should make sure that they are fully informed about sex so
that if they do have sex, they go into it at least a little less blindly and are able to
make better decision regarding sex.

Chapter 4: Informal fallacies

As with other fallacies of relevance, straw man fallacies can be compelling on
some level, even though they are irrelevant. It may be that part of the reason
we are taken in by straw man fallacies is that humans are prone to ``demonize"
the ``other"--including those who hold a moral or political position different
from our own. It is easy to think bad things about those with whom we do not
regularly interact. And it is easy to forget that people who are different than us
are still people just like us in all the important respects. Many years ago,
atheists were commonly thought of as highly immoral people and stories about
the horrible things that atheists did in secret circulated widely. People believed
that these strange ``others" were capable of the most horrible savagery. After
all, they may have reasoned, if you don't believe there is a God holding us
accountable, why be moral? The Jewish philosopher, Baruch Spinoza, was an
atheist who lived in the Netherlands in the 17th century. He was accused of all
sorts of things that were commonly believed about atheists. But he was in fact
as upstanding and moral as any person you could imagine. The people who
knew Spinoza knew better, but how could so many people be so wrong about
Spinoza? I suspect that part of the reason is that since at that time there were
very few atheists (or at least very few people actually admitted to it), very few
people ever knowingly encountered an atheist. Because of this, the stories
about atheists could proliferate without being put in check by the facts. I
suspect the same kind of phenomenon explains why certain kinds of straw man
fallacies proliferate. If you are a conservative and mostly only interact with other
conservatives, you might be prone to holding lots of false beliefs about liberals.
And so maybe you are less prone to notice straw man fallacies targeted at
liberals because the false beliefs you hold about them incline you to see the
straw man fallacies as true.
4.3.3 Tu quoque
``Tu quoque" is a Latin phrase that can be translated into English as ``you too"
or ``you, also." The tu quoque fallacy is a way of avoiding answering a criticism
by bringing up a criticism of your opponent rather than answer the criticism. For
example, suppose that two political candidates, A and B, are discussing their
policies and A brings up a criticism of B's policy. In response, B brings up her
own criticism of A's policy rather than respond to A's criticism of her policy. B
has here committed the tu quoque fallacy. The fallacy is best understood as a
way of avoiding having to answer a tough criticism that one may not have a
good answer to. This kind of thing happens all the time in political discourse.

203

Chapter 4: Informal fallacies

Tu quoque, as I have presented it, is fallacious when the criticism one raises is
simply in order to avoid having to answer a difficult objection to one's argument
or view. However, there are circumstances in which a tu quoque kind of
response is not fallacious. If the criticism that A brings toward B is a criticism
that equally applies not only to A's position but to any position, then B is right to
point this fact out. For example, suppose that A criticizes B for taking money
from special interest groups. In this case, B would be totally right (and there
would be no tu quoque fallacy committed) to respond that not only does A take
money from special interest groups, but every political candidate running for
office does. That is just a fact of life in American politics today. So A really has
no criticism at all to B since everyone does what B is doing and it is in many
ways unavoidable. Thus, B could (and should) respond with a ``you too" rebuttal
and in this case that rebuttal is not a tu quoque fallacy.
4.3.4 Genetic fallacy
The genetic fallacy occurs when one argues (or, more commonly, implies) that
the origin of something (e.g., a theory, idea, policy, etc.) is a reason for rejecting
(or accepting) it. For example, suppose that Jack is arguing that we should
allow physician assisted suicide and Jill responds that that idea first was used in
Nazi Germany. Jill has just committed a genetic fallacy because she is implying
that because the idea is associated with Nazi Germany, there must be
something wrong with the idea itself. What she should have done instead is
explain what, exactly, is wrong with the idea rather than simply assuming that
there must be something wrong with it since it has a negative origin. The origin
of an idea has nothing inherently to do with its truth or plausibility. Suppose
that Hitler constructed a mathematical proof in his early adulthood (he didn't,
but just suppose). The validity of that mathematical proof stands on its own; the
fact that Hitler was a horrible person has nothing to do with whether the proof is
good. Likewise with any other idea: ideas must be assessed on their own merits
and the origin of an idea is neither a merit nor demerit of the idea.
Although genetic fallacies are most often committed when one associates an
idea with a negative origin, it can also go the other way: one can imply that
because the idea has a positive origin, the idea must be true or more plausible.
For example, suppose that Jill argues that the Golden Rule is a good way to live
one's life because the Golden Rule originated with Jesus in the Sermon on the
Mount (it didn't, actually, even though Jesus does state a version of the Golden
Rule). Jill has committed the genetic fallacy in assuming that the (presumed)

204

Chapter 4: Informal fallacies

fact that Jesus is the origin of the Golden Rule has anything to do with whether
the Golden Rule is a good idea.
I'll end with an example from William James's seminal work, The Varieties of
Religious Experience. In that book (originally a set of lectures), James considers
the idea that if religious experiences could be explained in terms of neurological
causes, then the legitimacy of the religious experience is undermined. James,
being a materialist who thinks that all mental states are physical states--
ultimately a matter of complex brain chemistry, says that the fact that any
religious experience has a physical cause does not undermine that veracity of
that experience. Although he doesn't use the term explicitly, James claims that
the claim that the physical origin of some experience undermines the veracity of
that experience is a genetic fallacy. Origin is irrelevant for assessing the veracity
of an experience, James thinks. In fact, he thinks that religious dogmatists who
take the origin of the Bible to be the word of God are making exactly the same
mistake as those who think that a physical explanation of a religious experience
would undermine its veracity. We must assess ideas for their merits, James
thinks, not their origins.
4.3.5 Appeal to consequences
The appeal to consequences fallacy is like the reverse of the genetic fallacy:
whereas the genetic fallacy consists in the mistake of trying to assess the truth or
reasonableness of an idea based on the origin of the idea, the appeal to
consequences fallacy consists in the mistake of trying to assess the truth or
reasonableness of an idea based on the (typically negative) consequences of
accepting that idea. For example, suppose that the results of a study revealed
that there are IQ differences between different races (this is a fictitious example,
there is no such study that I know of). In debating the results of this study, one
researcher claims that if we were to accept these results, it would lead to
increased racism in our society, which is not tolerable. Therefore, these results
must not be right since if they were accepted, it would lead to increased racism.
The researcher who responded in this way has committed the appeal to
consequences fallacy. Again, we must assess the study on its own merits. If
there is something wrong with the study, some flaw in its design, for example,
then that would be a relevant criticism of the study. However, the fact that the
results of the study, if widely circulated, would have a negative effect on society
is not a reason for rejecting these results as false. The consequences of some
idea (good or bad) are irrelevant to the truth or reasonableness of that idea.

205

Chapter 4: Informal fallacies

Notice that the researchers, being convinced of the negative consequences of
the study on society, might rationally choose not to publish the study (for fear of
the negative consequences). This is totally fine and is not a fallacy. The fallacy
consists not in choosing not to publish something that could have adverse
consequences, but in claiming that the results themselves are undermined by
the negative consequences they could have. The fact is, sometimes truth can
have negative consequences and falsehoods can have positive consequences.
This just goes to show that the consequences of an idea are irrelevant to the
truth or reasonableness of an idea.
4.3.6 Appeal to authority
In a society like ours, we have to rely on authorities to get on in life. For
example, the things I believe about electrons are not things that I have ever
verified for myself. Rather, I have to rely on the testimony and authority of
physicists to tell me what electrons are like. Likewise, when there is something
wrong with my car, I have to rely on a mechanic (since I lack that expertise) to
tell me what is wrong with it. Such is modern life. So there is nothing wrong
with needing to rely on authority figures in certain fields (people with the
relevant expertise in that field)--it is inescapable. The problem comes when we
invoke someone whose expertise is not relevant to the issue for which we are
invoking it. For example, suppose that a group of doctors sign a petition to
prohibit abortions, claiming that abortions are morally wrong. If Bob cites that
fact that these doctors are against abortion, therefore abortion must be morally
wrong, then Bob has committed the appeal to authority fallacy. The problem is
that doctors are not authorities on what is morally right or wrong. Even if they
are authorities on how the body works and how to perform certain procedures
(such as abortion), it doesn't follow that they are authorities on whether or not
these procedures should be performed--the ethical status of these procedures.
It would be just as much an appeal to consequences fallacy if Melissa were to
argue that since some other group of doctors supported abortion, that shows
that it must be morally acceptable. In either case, since doctors are not
authorities on moral issues, their opinions on a moral issue like abortion is
irrelevant. In general, an appeal to authority fallacy occurs when someone takes
what an individual says as evidence for some claim, when that individual has no
particular expertise in the relevant domain (even if they do have expertise in
some other, unrelated, domain).
